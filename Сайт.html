        <h2>Добро пожаловать</h2>
        <p>Это сайт, посвященный книге "Название Книги". to American military basing objectives. We remain grateful to all partici-pants and discussants who joined us for the full-day virtual workshop from Europe, the People’s Republic of China, and the U.S. academic and think-tank communities.
Although our project was initially conceived as a special issue for an academic journal—and indeed a couple of papers initially developed out of the virtual conference were accepted for publication in the journal Security Studies—the strong policy bent of many of the papers allowed us to take the project in a somewhat different direction. Andrew’s return to Washington, D.C., and his new appointment at the Brookings Institution in January 2022 offered new opportunities for engagement with the policy community on issues related to geostrategic competition and overseas bases. We are espe¬cially indebted to Michael O’Hanlon, director of the Strobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology (Talbott Center) at the Brookings In¬stitution, who took a keen interest on the topic of overseas bases and gener¬ously offered to provide funding for the project with support from Brookings Trustee Phil Knight. The grant allowed us to host an in-person workshop at Brookings in November 2022, bringing together scholars across different centers housed within the Brookings Foreign Policy program as well as ex¬perts from other universities and think tanks. The workshop resulted in a series of policy reports published by Brookings in January 2023. Our con¬tributors (and a few authors recruited afterward) later expanded the depth and scope of their analysis, allowing us to put together a full volume on geostrategic competition and Chinese, Russian, and U.S. bases.
Given the number of people directly and indirectly involved in this proj¬ect over the past four years, there is a long list of friends and colleagues we need to thank. We are most of all grateful to all the contributors to this volume who responded to our many requests for revisions and meeting deadlines over the past year despite their busy schedules. We also extend our thanks to those who participated in the November 2022 Brookings workshop. This includes Joshua White and Jason Wolff, who served as dis¬cussants, and also Sebastian Schmidt, Steve Watts, and Darshana Baruah for their input and participation. We (especially Isaac) would like to thank the National Bureau of Asian Research and National Defense University’s National Asian Research Program fellowship for providing the platform for initial research on Chinese basing that resulted in Andrew reaching out to discuss comparative directions for future research.
We thank Ron Krebs and Sheena Greitens as well as two anonymous reviewers for the journal Security Studies who gave us valuable feedback in earlier iterations of the project. We also want to acknowledge participants who joined our virtual conference at Catholic University during an earlier stage of this project as either a presenter or a discussant. This group includes Andrew Scobell, Hu Bo, Jeff Becker, Dmitry Gorenburg, Maria Shagina, Brian Blankenship, Renanah Miles Joyce, Andrew Stravers, Drew Winner, Carla Martinez Machain, Michael Flynn, Michael Allen, Charlie Edel, Se¬bastian Schmidt, John Caverley, Paul MacDonald, and Alex Cooley. Alex helped spark the idea of studying overseas bases comparatively during our panel session at the 2019 International Studies Association annual conven¬tion in Toronto. We hope to one day take up his other suggestion to orga¬nize a study tour to Djibouti to understand foreign bases! Finally, Valerie De Koeijer graciously took notes for us, and Matthew Cantirino provided logistical support.
We would like to thank several people at the Brookings Institution who provided extensive support and encouragement toward the completion of this project. This includes Suzanne Maloney, vice president of the Foreign Policy program, and Mike O’Hanlon (again) for allowing us (specifically Andrew) to run with the project. Andrew thanks Mike for agreeing to co-author not one but two chapters in this volume. We also benefited from conversations with several Brookings federal executive fellows serving in different branches of the military, including Colonel Jason Wolff, U.S. Air Force; Colonel Marcos Melendez, U.S. Marine Corps; Captain Brad Mc-Nally, U.S. Coast Guard; and Jeremy Greenwood, U.S. Coast Guard. Alex Dimsdale, Lori Merritt, and Rachel Slattery helped refine initial arguments with their editing and layout of the earlier policy reports. Jennifer Mason helped manage our grant and offered her sage logistical advice and support. At Brookings Institution Press, we are very grateful to Yelba Quinn, who remained supportive of our project from the moment we first pitched our book idea to her. With wisdom and patience, Yelba helped us navigate our proposal with Rowman & Littlefield, led by Jon Sisk and his editorial and production team, including Mary Wheelehan. Finally, we could not have pushed this edited book past the goalpost without the able assistance of Hanna Foreman. Hanna played a hand in almost every aspect of this project from the first day she joined the Brookings Institution as a research assistant in October 2022. We (especially Andrew) very much appreciate her support, good humor, and baked goods. 
Great Power Competition
and Overseas Bases
U.S., Chinese, and Russian Force
Posture in the Twenty-First Century
ANDREW YEO
ISAAC KARDON
Chinese and Russian strategic ambitions on land and sea and in aerospace and cyberspace are transforming the contemporary international security environment. The 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS) character¬ized these trends as the return of “great power competition”;1 the 2022 NSS continued in this vein, expressing U.S. intent to “out-compete” China and “constrain” Russia in order to “maintain a competitive edge.”2 This competi¬tive characterization of world affairs also holds sway in Moscow and Beijing, where, in word and in deed, overt great power strategic competition is also the prevailing mindset.
The global military posture of the United States is arguably one of its remaining competitive edges in a challenging international system. The United States stands alone in fielding a genuinely global military force, with power projection capabilities deployed forward in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East since World War II. The basing and access arrangements af-forded by a robust network of allies and partners are fundamental to the presence and high-end capability of U.S. forces in all major world regions. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the consolidation of U.S. basing posture over the course of wars in the Balkans and the Middle East, there has been little competition on this account.
However, the apparently unique advantage of overseas bases that the United States holds is not unassailable. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s saber-rattling around Taiwan and the western Pacific present acute, near-term threats as well as long-term, strategic challenges. This onset of direct, great power military competition is testing the geostrategic value proposition of America’s global force posture. American forces are oper-ating forward from foreign basing infrastructure as its great power rivals engage in actual (Russia) and potential (China) regional conflicts. These are profound tests of both deterrent and war-fighting roles for American forces based in eastern Europe and East Asia.
In parallel, these resurgent authoritarian nations have reestablished military footholds in East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa—and are pur-suing further access and basing in other theaters. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) established its first overseas military base in 2017 at Djibouti and further signaled that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will continue to expand its foreign military operations.3 Russia increasingly utilizes ele-ments of the former Soviet basing network in Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Russian forces staged part of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine from positions in Belarus.4 The United States, meanwhile, is seeking to counter the expansion of rival basing positions while rebalancing its global posture toward the primary strategic challenge of China.5
This volume takes stock of the emerging dynamics of great power com-petition for overseas military bases and base access. The chapters that follow demonstrate that overseas military bases play crucial but distinct roles in each great power’s global strategy in select world regions. In general, bases are a means to project power and influence abroad, meet logistics require¬ments, secure economic access and trade flows, forge and maintain alliances and partnerships, and deter adversaries. They are also ends, signaling pres¬tige and strength in distant theaters. Their actual, practical functions are far from obvious, however, and there has been no systematic effort to date that stacks up U.S., Chinese, and Russian basing postures and ambitions in an effort to understand their competitive dynamics.
Our comparative analysis of great power military bases is the first of its kind. By exploring the security, political economic, and domestic po¬litical dynamics of specific regions, we offer structured comparisons that reveal varied great power motivations for overseas bases and access. This regional approach yields greater leverage in understanding the political¬military stakes and geographic positions for which great powers are com¬peting. From this perspective, we find that great power competition and the dynamics of basing progresses unevenly in different parts of the world. The particulars of each region, explored in this volume’s chapters, give us a valu¬able window into the nature and scope of the competition under way in the contemporary “great power competition.”
GEOSTRATEGIC COMPETITION FOR BASING
The Existing Basing Literature
Scholarship on base politics and overseas basing has grown significantly over the past few decades. Whereas early studies tended to present either macro- historical accounts of U.S. overseas basing strategy and force posture6 or in¬depth case studies of U.S. basing in specific countries,7 a new generation of scholars in the 2000s delved deeper into the underlying mechanisms driv¬ing base politics. These later studies touch on issues of regional security and strategy but lay greater emphasis on the roles of host governments and local politics and their effects on measurable basing outcomes. Domestic vari¬ables, such as political institutions,8 regime type,9 and anti-base protests,10 factored significantly in this mode of analysis. Other researchers demon¬strated how contentious politics challenged U.S. force presence, thereby creating vulnerabilities in great power basing strategy.11 Scholars have ex¬plained this shift from large, permanent bases toward a smaller and lighter footprint over time in reference to a combination of strategic, technological, and domestic political factors.12
The existing research on overseas bases has focused almost entirely on the experience of the United States.13 Such a concentration stands to reason given that the vast majority of foreign bases around the world today are U.S. bases (some 544 by the Department of Defense’s last public inventory in 2021).14 The other countries that maintain overseas bases—France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Turkey, and a few others—are largely U.S. allies and also host U.S. bases on their own territory. These may reasonably be deemed lesser-included cases or a peripheral subset of the larger phenom¬enon of a U.S.-led basing network. Yet they are also part of a more interest¬ing and underappreciated story of the United States and its allies facing new competitive pressures from powerful new (or, in the case of Russia, return¬ing) entrants to overseas basing in the twenty-first century with growing appetites for friction and confrontation.
